We do not discriminate against any breed (although we regret that we cannot accommodate horses, cows, pigs, or llamas ☺ ). All passengers 18 years of age and older are welcome. Minors must be accompanied by an adult. By offering pet accessories for the vehicle, Petmo provides comfortable, pleasant surroundings to keep your pet calm for the duration of the trip. Your pet can stretch out in our climate-controlled economy or luxury vehicles. Petmo provides bottled drinking water. If the service extends for more than one hour, we can take your pet for a walk. We take the safety of our passengers very seriously and pride ourselves on our reputation. We require background checks on each of our chauffeurs/drivers, each driver completes a Petmo safety course, and each client receives their driver’s contact information prior to the scheduled pickup time. Drivers are pet lovers, with some studying to be in the pet-serving industry — a quality we search for. We'll Love Your Pet, Just as You Do! Our drivers are experienced chauffeurs who are also animal lovers. These qualities ensure that all of our passengers are cared for as if they were our family. No matter what you have planned with your pet, let Petmo take you there. Pet Playdates Let Petmo take your furry friend or both of you to your playdate. Even if it’s a day road trip, just book in advance and Petmo will be your friend for the ride. Veterinarian Visits​ Have a checkup coming up?
